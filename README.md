# FT-MOEA-CM

The approach presented in this algorithm aims to infer fault tree models from given failure data sets. Based on the implementation of [FT-MOEA](https://gitlab.utwente.nl/fmt/fault-trees/ft-moea), FT-MOEA-CM introduces the use of confusion matrix metrics instead of metrics based on Minimal Cut Sets. Additionally, it introduces the use of parallel computation to leverage the availability of multiple CPUs.
